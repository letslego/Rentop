    "**Problem:** The problem we are trying to solve is two-fold: First, it is to provide feedback to owners and agents on how to optimize listings to generate interest. Secondly, it helps RentHop identify potential issues with listings and fraud. Both of these should help customers better identify relevant listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics:** The relevant metric is accurate prediction of high, medium, and low interest. \n",
    "We would like to increase accuracy to 80% correct identification of high, medium, or low interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delivery:** We will deliver a model that predicts the probability of high, medium, and low interest for a given listing.\n",

    "*Note:* For the purposes of this assignment, we will not be doing analysis of images provided with the competition and will mainly be focusing on using existing features (e.g. text, and values) to try to predict interest level."
